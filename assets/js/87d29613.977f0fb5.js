Go and take your place with the alchemists.\\"*** \\n\\n\u2014\u2009Leonardo da Vinci, 1494\\n\\nPerpetual motion is the motion of bodies that ***continues forever in an unperturbed system. A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that can do work infinitely without an external energy source.*** This kind of machine is impossible, as it would violate either the first or second law of thermodynamics or both.\\n\\nLuckily for us we\'re dealing with the laws of crypto economics, not thermodynamics. The behavior of monetary systems can in fact be modeled using Physic\'s first principles and the inmaterial nature of it allows for the creation of systems that go beyon the constraints of the phisical world. However, the laws of thermodiamics offer a glimpse of what is required to create an infinitely sustainable monetary system, which in fact is a perpetual motion machine.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n***The first law*** describes the of conservation of energy states postulating that the total energy of any isolated system (for which energy and matter transfer through the system boundary are not possible) is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed.\\n\\n***The second law*** may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium where the entropy is highest at the given internal energy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Money is a form of Energy\\n\\nIn physics, ***energy*** is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes. In other words, both money and energy can be described as a quantitative property that is transfered in exchange for work. Unlike energy however, money can in fact be created and destroyed. Which is the first key we need to create a perpetual motion machine\\n\\n## Can Entropy be Reduced?\\n\\n***\u201cTHERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\u201d***\\n\\n-Multivac, 2061\\n\\n***Entropy*** is a scientific concept as well as a measurable physical property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. In the phisical world the overall entropy always increases: things tend to go from a state of order to disorder if left unchecked. Although the total entropy of the universe cannot ever decrease energy (read: money) can be spent to fight off entropy locally. Thats why we eat food in order and reduce our body entropy by repairing and replacing cells. Ultimately however, in the physical world entropy always wins. \\n\\n## Entropy Reduction = Value Creation\\n\\nImagine you could deploy custom laws of physics. Thats what solidity is like. If entropy is a measure of unceartanty smart contracts are anti-entropy devices for they describe deterministic functions that organize energy(read: money). For example; The UniSwap smart contracts organize thousands of pairs from houndreds of thousands of users in order to allow atomic swaps between any asset pair. The fact that UniSwap is deployed in the network reduces the total entropy and increased the value of everything within.\\n\\nIn the case of StrudelDAO our source of entropy is the vBTC peg. Our protocol aims to reduce this entropy by deploying incentive structures that produce energy (read: money) in order to incentivize actions that achieve this goal. Once we manage to achieve the peg we know that value will have ben created for the protocol which we can compound on by offering a product that can be built upon by other protocols which are also creating on chain value. \\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/X0iDfFy.png)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ycdmrfp.png)\\n\\n\\n## the Strudel Bitcoin Metabolism\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yoDN0iB.png)\\n\\nThe above graphic is a schematic of an enzimatic pathway. In Biological systems enzimatic pathways are a series of chemical reactions that transform a molecule for a specific purpose. Aditionally, enzimes are interoperable and often have multiple uses throughout the body. Furthermore, enzimatic processes often trigger multiple other processes downstream to create complex behaviours found throughout nature.\\n\\nThe Strudel Protocol employs a similar approach to the design of the incentive scheme for the vBTC peg. In order to produce a pegged Bitcoin asset the protocol employs multiple incentive mechanisms in multiple chains to create complex arbitrage patterns that peg vBTC to the Bitcoin price. \\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9z9ZRlc.png)\\n\\n### Entering the Strudel\\nThe strudel protocol creates an incentive for users to bridge BTC into the ethereum network due to an arbitrage between the vBTC price and BTC price. The price of vBTC is determined by the existing liquidity. Whenever vBTC is above the peg new coins are minted to close the arbitrage. Once inside the ETH network users can use their vBTC in a variety of yield farming oppportunities to earn $TRDL tokens. \\n\\n\\nThe current deployed components of the protocol interacting with vBTC are:\\n\\n* ETH\\n    * Strudel Protocol\\n        * Bridge Contracts\\n        * MasterChef yield farm\\n* Bridge\\n    * Multichain.xyz\\n        * ETH<->FTM bridge\\n* FTM\\n    * ORKAN\\n        * Bonds\\n            * vBTC\\n            * $M\\n    * MitiCushqui\\n        * Stablecoin\\n            * $M\\n\\n### Orkanization\\n\\nIn the FTM network, ORKAN offers perpetual bonds offering Orkan tokens for vBTC and $M which generate consistent buying pressure for vBTC which pulls tokens from the Ethereum network into Fantom. Orkan aims to create the largest on chain BTC repository and removes vBTC from circulation, reducing the floating circulating supply and increasing the mainnet vBTC price. At the same time, the reserves acquired will be deployed in order to obtain interest bearing opportunities for $M and vBTC holders throughout the FTM DeFi ecosystem\\n\\n### Back to Basics: BTC Backed Reserve Currency\\n\\nThe last piece of the puzzle is our stablecoin issuing procotol: [mitiCushqui\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5](https://y.at/\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5). This protocol issues a stablecoin backed by USDC and vBTC. We created an oracle that pegs vBTC to the BTC price effectively creating an arbitrage that will mint $M at a discount and redeem for $USDC as long as vBTC is under the peg.  Once the arbitrage is closed $M issuance will serve as a backstop to preserve the vBTC peg as the BTC price varies. \\n\\n### Perpetual Motion\\n\\nThe incentive structures decribed above should generate perpetual motion by creating a system which tends to return equilibrium point where vBTC is pegged to the BTC price.  If such state of homeostasis is achieved the system would go on forever mantaining a stable peg for a growing vBTC market. The implications of this scenario for the Strudel Protocol are inmense: \\n* Strudel could secure a significant portion of the BTC network for the DeFi ecosystem forever. Merging BTC and DeFI irreversively.  \\n* ORKAN would become the biggest on chain decentralized repository of BTC. \\n* $M would become one of the most reliable reserve currencies in DeFi, serving as a base asset for many other community specific stable assets."},{"id":"what-is-nerd","metadata":{"permalink":"/nerddao/blog/what-is-nerd","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/what-is-NERD.md","source":"@site/blog/what-is-NERD.md","title":"What is \ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd13?","description":"Introduction","date":"2022-08-01T16:07:12.165Z","formattedDate":"August 1, 2022","tags":[{"label":"strudel","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/strudel"},{"label":"bitcoin","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/bitcoin"}],"readingTime":3.985,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"what-is-nerd","title":"What is \ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd13?","authors":{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"},"tags":["strudel","bitcoin"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Building a Crypto Perpetual Motion Machine","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/perpetual-motion"},"nextItem":{"title":"Strudel Bitcoin Investment Briefing","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/strudel-briefing"}},"content":"##  Introduction\\n\\nWhat is NerdDAO\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd13?\\n\\nIn principle, it\'s a newsletter that\'s going to try and record NerdDAO Activity. Instead of \\"publishing\\" a periodical this is going to be a long form series of articles which can be accessed through https://y.at/\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd13. I\'m going to try and get notable members of the Nerdquarters to contribute on a varied range of subjects. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n A word about myself. I\'m known online as At0x.eth. Before being in crypto I became a M.D but took interest in data science and worked with a research group publishing several papers. Basically, I have always been a huge nerd. I used to play countless hours of WoW as a kid and have been running VR side hustles for over 5 years now. \\n<center>\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://giphy.com/embed/xghFgmOKbk0G4\\" width=\\"480\\" height=\\"321\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" class=\\"giphy-embed\\" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\\"https://giphy.com/gifs/smiling-spongebob-squarepants-nerd-xghFgmOKbk0G4\\">via GIPHY</a></p>\\n\\n</center>\\n\\n\\nI\'ve been aware of blockchain for a long time but did only start participating around june 2020 because covid made me reconsider my carreer choice. When I first joined into crypto telegram madness, I found there was no room for deep technical discourse if it was not related to a \\"when pump\\" statement. In a space where \\"in it for the technology\\" is used as a joke I needed to create a group where we\'re really in it for the tech. a place for Nerds.\\n\\n## Enter The NerdQuarters \\nhttps://y.at/\ud83e\udd13\u2709\ufe0f\ud83e\udd13\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MantluU.jpg)\\n\\nThe Nerdquarters is the core of the Nerd community. We have created an open source community where nerds come and share information to make sense of it together. It is also a place for newcomers to ask questions and avoid repeating the same mistakes we\'ve already learned from.\\n\\n\\nAs we have grown we have started to interact with alot of new tools for decentralized communities which have allowed us to coordinate to embark on several ventures. We dont need venture capital money because we do everything in house. We just want to have fun and experience the growth of the infinite machine. \\n\\n\\n## NERD DAO\\n\\nThe Nerd DAO is the on chain representation of the NERD commuinity. We created the DAO using [EthOS](https://ethos.eth.link).  EthOS is a permissionless and decentralized governance protocol that allows anyone to create their own DAO with its own token, treasury and governance interface. We are one of the earliest external users of EthOS. \\n\\nThe Nerd DAO is not explicitly intended to be a for profit venture. The initial tokens were airdropped to members of the telegram chat. Over 80% of the supply is still held by the Treasury wallet. There are no insider backers and nobody has special privileges or access over the token. Furthermore the NERD Treasury owns the initial LP used for the token. However, we have undertaken for profit ventures in the form of products and services such as our Nerd Fungible Trust group investment and our upcoming [Redacted] trading platform which will pay fees to the DAO.\\n\\nThrough all these ventures and experiences we have learned a thing or two about how the metaverse is being built. We have also started to etch our own corned of the metaverse by starting to interconnect experiences and information through Web3 interfaces. As our network becomes more expansive we\'re starting to learn what the metaverse really is and how its different from the way we used to do things. As proof, here\'s a picture of our latest development meeting for one of our projects.\\n<center>\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EzihW4B.png)\\n</center>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Nerd DAO  Metaverse Manifesto\\n\\n- ***We believe that the Metaverse is a series of interconected experiences through which an individual can traverse while preserving their identity. ***\\n    - In that context we believe that the role of the Nerd DAO is to create and connect experiences for its members to traverse. We are here to buidl our corner of the Metaverse.\\n\\n- ***We believe that a metaverse is a place for human connection and therefore our goal is to make it enticing for people to inhabit our spaces in order to collaborate, play and learn together.***\\n\\n- ***We know that the metaverse HAS to be fun. If the metaverse feels like work, we\'re not there yet.***\\n\\n\\n## How To Participate?\\n\\nQ: Who can contribute to Nerd?\\n\\nA: You\\n\\nNerd has no papers of incorporation, no headquarters, nor even a list of names and locations for its contributors\\n\\nWe follow [Yearn\'s](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1445799269189881864?s=20) radical decentralization model. Which means that anyone can join up our community and contribute. Join the Nerdquarters chat! We are always talking about the daily happenings and there\'s plenty of people eager to explain away any questions others may have. Once you are there you can join our development groups or create your own and recieve help and guidance from the other nerds on how to apply your time to start your crypto adventure.\\n### Explore our Metaverse:  https://y.at/%F0%9F%92%BB%F0%9F%A4%93%F0%9F%92%B0"},{"id":"strudel-briefing","metadata":{"permalink":"/nerddao/blog/strudel-briefing","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2019-05-28-first-blog-post copy.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-28-first-blog-post copy.md","title":"Strudel Bitcoin Investment Briefing","description":"The Strudel Bridge","date":"2019-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 28, 2019","tags":[{"label":"strudel","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/strudel"},{"label":"bitcoin","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/bitcoin"}],"readingTime":4.815,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"strudel-briefing","title":"Strudel Bitcoin Investment Briefing","authors":{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"},"tags":["strudel","bitcoin"]},"prevItem":{"title":"What is \ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd13?","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/what-is-nerd"}},"content":"## The Strudel Bridge\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xKZ9G1Z.png)\\n\\n**By eliminating the need for custodial control of assets** that come with typical wrappers, the Strudel protocol trades off counter-party risk for market risk while using **market dynamics, crypto-economic incentives, and cross-chain capabilities** to maintain a pegged, scalable, and capital-efficient ecosystem. This one-of-a-kind economic approach offers average users and big money investors numerous options for monetary growth and grants more diversity and security to DeFi.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n# Problem Statement\\n\\n**Bitcoin**  is poorly incorporated into web3. The existing landscape relies mainly on wBTC, a trusted bridge operated primarily by funds such as 3AC, which have the exclusive right to mint and burn wBTC, therefore cornering the benefit of the arbitrage between on-chain BTC and legacy markets.\\n\\nVitalik [has stated](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1295252403558559746?s=20&t=UvAU_6bfaNeaIVcafixefg) that trusted BTC bridges pose a systemic risk to the DeFi ecosystem. I would go even further and say that DeFi cannot grow until its intimately integrated with BTC and we capture a significant % of the BTC network on-chain. To achieve this goal, we must find a robust solution to bridge many BTC into the Web3 economy.\\n\\n\\n \\n## The On Chain Bitcoin Landscape\\n\\n[Updated Dashboard](https://dune.com/eliasimos/btc-on-ethereum_1)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AyKNaM9.png)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vYAyc5x.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n- Less than 1.5% of the BTC supply is currently bridged on-chain.\\n- On-chain, BTC balances are very stable compared to price volatility.\\n- Trusted bridges (wBTC+hBTC) represent over 90% of all the BTC bridged on-chain.\\n- Decentralized alternatives have not found strong PmF: RenBTC only has 4,000 BTC bridged. Hardly 2% of the total on-chain BTC\\n\\n\\n## Strudel Bridge Architecture\\n\\nWhen BTC is requested to be transferred using the Strudel dApp, a transaction output with the transfer amount and the receiving Ethereum wallet address is created. This output is handed to the user\u2019s Bitcoin wallet through the QR code. When a user signs a transfer, the resulting transaction might look like this.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eGRRlhh.png)\\n\\nNext, the header of the Bitcoin block containing the transaction needs to be registered in the relayer contract on Ethereum, where its proof-of-work is verified, and the canonical chain is extended. Simple payment verification (SPV), a protocol used by Bitcoin light clients and wallets, prevents invalid blocks from entering the relayer.\\nOnce the transaction containing the burn has been buried under enough proof of work (6 blocks), an inclusion proof is relayed onto Ethereum. The proof is verified by the Strudel contract, which mints vBTC in a ratio of 1:1 to the designated Ethereum address. The protocol strictly mints one vBTC for one burned BTC, not taking any fees for bridge crossings.\\n\\n## Strudel Bitcoin\\n\\nToken Address: 0xe1406825186d63980fd6e2ec61888f7b91c4bae4\\n\\nCurrent vBTC Supply: 23.27238764 \\n\\nToken Distribution:\\n\\nHodlers: 461 \\n\\nTotal Liquidity: ~120,000 USD combined\\n\\nMarket Cap: 230,000 USD\\n\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/llQkTCg.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce BTC crosses the bridge using the Strudel Protocol its issued as Strudel Bitcoin (vBTC) on the Ethereum network. vBTC is **fully erc20 compliant** with 18 decimals and flash loan capabilities. \\n\\nhttps://etherscan.io/token/0xe1406825186d63980fd6e2ec61888f7b91c4bae4\\nhttps://ftmscan.com/token/0x9049198f6b21acf1e050cfcf36a6879a07b0bbe4\\n\\n### Historic Performance\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vVcjWIe.png)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/c5Jhu6c.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n- vBTC has outperformed both ETH (+86%) and BTC (+53%) YTD\\n- The Strudel Protocol controls > 50% of vBTC, which are acquired through Orkan.Finance bond issuance and MitiCushqui stablecoin issuance.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Liquidity landscape\\n\\nStrudel utilizes a [mandate based approach](https://app.gitbook.com/o/V40TVngLYntzpq24zWhI/s/9QESb5e46FBDH1t8kShd/monetary-policy/mandates) to guide the development of the protocol\\n\\n**Mandate #1 - Achieve true decentralization of BTC on DeFi\\nMandate #2  - Design incentive structures that issue and manage reserve backed currencies**\\n\\nBy utilizing vBTC as a reserve asset, we reduce the floating supply and therefore provide price stability when interacting with demand driven by incentives to provide liquidity for vBTC\\n\\n**Liquidity Incentives**\\n\\nThe first stop for vBTC once bridged is the strudel. Finance farms. The protocol utilizes a sushi-style LP farm to issue 1 $TRDL per block split evenly among the following positions:\\n\\n- $TRDL:ETH(Pool0) (320%APY)\\n- vBTC:$TRDL (73.51%APY)\\n- vBTC:ETH (14.96%APY)\\n- vNFT::vBTC:PUNK:CC:BAYC (NA* APY)\\n\\n*have to develop code to calculate price on multi asset pool to use in APY formula. \\n\\n**Reserve Backed Currencies**\\n\\n**Orkan.finance**\\n\\n**$vBTC\'s peg through The Orkan** \\n- When $vBTC gets under the peg, $ORK bonds are issued to increase the treasury supply and therefore remove $vBTC from circulation\\n- When $vBTC gets above the peg, previously acquired $vBTC is exchanged by the protocol for other assets to diversify the treasury basket or to buy back and burn $ORK.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b2V7Yoo.png)\\n\\n**vBTC as a Store of Value**\\n\\nThe Orkan treasury has managed to retain most of the value issued for the purchase of vBTC even though the market has gone through a significant downturn. ORK is trading at .40c, whereas the backing per token is 1.22c.\\n\\n**\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5MitiCushqui\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5**\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/axrQqVG.png)\\n\\n\\nWe recently deployed MitiCushqui, a [stablecoin issuing protocol](https://y.at/\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5). This protocol can be used to deploy redeemable stablecoins backed by a fixed ratio of a base stablecoin and any other asset. \\n\\nThe protocol oracles the BTC price and therefore creates an arbitrage where users can mint $Miti  at a discount and redeem for USDC. The vault keeps vBTC out of circulation therefore reducing the supply and increasing the price until the arbitrage is closed and the peg is met. \\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UC5UXFw.png)\\n\\n## The Future of Bitcoin is on-chain and the on-chain future is Bitcoin.\\n\\nTo make the web3 ecosystem more robust, we need to onboard a more significant percentage of BTC on-chain. A way to achieve reliable yields is to incentivize the flow of BTC into Web3. This capital can finance projects that generate value for the entire space. This makes BTC more useful, which is vital For it to gain mainstream adoption.\\n\\nThe future of BTC cannot depend on any one group of developers or caretakers. To realize its potential, we must find ways to bridge it into the Web3 ecosystem by utilizing as many techniques as possible and later building tools to create an interoperable interface\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn More:\\n\\nStrudel Twitter: @EnterTheStrudel\\nAt0x Twitter: @At0xNQ\\nNerd Chat: https://y.at/\ud83e\udd13\u2709\ufe0f\ud83e\udd13\\nStrudel Landing: https://y.at/\ud83c\udf2a\ud83c\udf2a\ud83d\udc40\\nMitiCushqui: https://y.at/\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5"}]}')}}]);
