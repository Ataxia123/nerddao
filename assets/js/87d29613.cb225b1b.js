With that in mind we have been working on several initiatives to do just that and keep building like we always have.\\n\\n## NerdOS x BuidlGuidl\\n### EthOS-Scaffold Starter Kit\\n\\nBuidlGuidl is a collective of web3 builders that use scaffold-eth as a common development framework. The BuidlGuidl is incentivizing builders to create using this framework via streams that are deliverded upon proof of continued work in a project.\\n\\nIn order to make it simple to start working with EthOS we are going to create a series of starter kits that can be forked into any product. We are going to start by creating a kit to have your own front end for your covenants farm.\\n\\n#### BuidlGuidl Grant!\\n\\nOur delegation recieved 10ETH in funding to bootstrap our development we will submit a proposal linking to this post to forward 2.5 ETH to the BuidlGuidl multisig in order to pay out a stream for builders who work with EthOS in their submitted builds. This includes helping out \\n\\n\\n### NerdOS Delegation Developer funding\\n\\nIn order to be able to complete our stated goals we want to guarantee incentives for  core contributors that can coordinate the work required to ship our deliverables. The funding we have recieved to bootstrap the delegation will be used to compensate the work done to as tracked through our deWork page. We will submit a coordinape report along with the proposal to retrieve the funds from the delegation.\\n \\n## Nerd Fungible Tokens\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nmU1NcQ.png)\\n\\nNerds love NFTs. We have created 2 collections of 10,000 AI nfts regenz.io and ai-universe.io to explore the latest in Synthography. We have also used Items to create a trading fund which owns a checkmark doodle.\\n\\nWe are going to keep experimenting with Items in all of our products. We have designed ai-universe.io to include the prompt as metadata attributes which allows us to use this collection to make our own Items. We plan to create incentivized pools for both Superheroes and Supervillains by deploying covenants that yield NERD tokens for liquidity provision on uniswapV3 using wrapped AI-Universe tokens.\\n\\n\\n## NERD token updates\\n\\nOver a longer period of time the intention is to migrate the NERD DFO into an EthOS guild. Until we can do that through the front end we will work on deepending the liquidity of the token by increasing the distribution through a set of covenants. \\n\\nThe goal of these farms is going to be to deepen the liquidity of the Nerd ecosystem as a whole including: $TRDL, vBTC, our structured products such as the vNFT fund. We also plan to incentivize liquidity for our upcoming ITEM decks using our latest collection @AI_UniverseNFT as well as @RegenzNFT\\n\\n\\n## Deliverables\\n\\n- Scaffold-EthOS starter kits for Covenant farms\\n- BuidlGuidl grant allocation for EthOS buidlrs\\n- AI_Universe Decks for Univ3 liquidity incentives\\n- NERD covenants & token distribution update"},{"id":"Network-State","metadata":{"permalink":"/nerddao/blog/Network-State","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/Nerdcon.md","source":"@site/blog/Nerdcon.md","title":"Visiting the Network State","description":".","date":"2022-10-27T19:03:44.000Z","formattedDate":"October 27, 2022","tags":[{"label":"nerddao","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/nerddao"},{"label":"DevCon","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/dev-con"},{"label":"ethereum","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/ethereum"}],"readingTime":3.595,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Network-State","title":"Visiting the Network State","authors":{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"},"tags":["nerddao","DevCon","ethereum"]},"prevItem":{"title":"NerdOs Delegation Update","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/Nerd-OS-Update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Infinite Universe Alliance Announcement","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/infinite-universe"}},"content":"![](https://i.imgur.com/aUMLH8H.jpg)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n## NerdCon: Visiting the Network State\\n\\nDevcon is an annual conference for Ethereum developers and other interested parties. This year, it was held in Bogota, Colombia. For a week, participants discussed Ethereum development and other related topics.\\n\\nOne of the main goals of Devcon is to build a strong network of developers who can work together to improve Ethereum and create new applications using its technology. In this way, Devcon also serves as a sort of \\"network state\\" - a community with the capacity for collective action that can fund territory around the world and eventually gain diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states.\\n\\nA side note on the the venue for the conference, Agora: It is a huge, imposing structure located in the heart of Bogota. It\'s one of the largest convention centers in all of South America, and it\'s constantly buzzing with activity. The building has a long and storied history, and it\'s played a major role in the development of Bogota.\\n\\n\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    \\n\\n  <img src=\\"https://i.imgur.com/7YNHaGC.jpg\\"/>\\n\\n    \\n</p>\\n\\nThe Agora Building was originally built back in 1954. It was initially used as a livestock market, but it soon became clear that there was much more potential for the building. In 1967, the Agora building was repurposed into a convention center. This proved to be a major boon for Bogota, as the city quickly became a major destination for conventions and trade shows.\\n\\n This was a perfect setting to host the Network State, and the organizers went above and beyond to make sure that everyone had a great time. The main talks of the conference were very insightful, and it was great to see so many people come together to discuss ways to scale Ethereum and resist censorship.\\n\\nI like to think of the Network State as a \\"collective of collectives\\" where everyone is representing the communities they belong to. This was evident at Devcon, where developers from all over the world came together to showcase their projects and share their experiences. One of the main benefits of being part of this community is the ability to radically collaborate. \\n\\nThe only real way to become part of the network state is to join one of the communities that makes up the network state. I came into DevCon representing NerdQuarters but also connected to and ended up representing the BuidlGuidl. The BuidlGuidl.com is a collective of web3 builders that believe that by sharing ideas and working together, we will able to make faster progress than what we would have been able to achieve on our own. The Guild has a tool [Scaffold-ETH](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/) that makes it easy to start developing in Web3. We then spent the whole time talking to other projects about how we could coordinate to create even more compelling use cases. Its a community built on the Open Source ethos and composability.\\n\\n\\n My time with the buidlguidl let me experience firsthand the support and camaraderie that members provide one another. This was especially apparent during the week-long conference, where developers were eager to help one another learn new skills and solve problems. We were showcasing https://speedrunethereum.com which is a tool to learn Web3 development and make it easty to start making dapps. We heard from many atendees that told us that the speedrun helped them to understand Web3 or that they had used it to write the smart contracts that won ETHBogota. \\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iLXESal.png)\\n\\nThe sense of community that exists within the BuidlGuidl is incredibly valuable, as it allows members to feel like they are a part of something larger than themselves. The buidlguidl supports its members by giving streams to meaningful crontributions. We also will play a key role between protocols and developers by creating starter kits along with prizes that incentivize our members to discover new protocols and create the next big thing on chain.\\n\\nThe future of the BuidlGuidl and the network state it represents is bright. With more and more people getting involved in Ethereum development, the community will only continue to grow and thrive.  Overall, DevCon was an incredible experience and everyone who attended should be very proud of what they have accomplished. The parties at the conference were also a lot of fun, and it was great to see so many people come together to celebrate this amazing technology.\\n\\n\\nJoin the Nerds! https://y.at/\ud83e\udd13\u2709\ud83e\udd13"},{"id":"infinite-universe","metadata":{"permalink":"/nerddao/blog/infinite-universe","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/aiUniverse.md","source":"@site/blog/aiUniverse.md","title":"Infinite Universe Alliance Announcement","description":"Introduction","date":"2022-10-27T19:03:44.000Z","formattedDate":"October 27, 2022","tags":[{"label":"nerd","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/nerd"},{"label":"nft","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/nft"},{"label":"AIUniverse","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/ai-universe"}],"readingTime":3.835,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"infinite-universe","title":"Infinite Universe Alliance Announcement","authors":{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"},"tags":["nerd","nft","AIUniverse"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Visiting the Network State","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/Network-State"},"nextItem":{"title":"NerdBogota","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/Nerd-Bogota"}},"content":"### Introduction\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VnCExrM.jpg)\\n\\nThe Observable Universe is finite, and it hasn\'t existed forever. It extends 46 billion light years in every direction from us. However, when telescopes fail our imagination can take us to infinity and beyond. A revolutionary new kind of camera was recently invented. Instead of turning light into pictures, it turns ideas into pictures using AI.This new kind of camera replicates what your imagination does. It receives words and then synthesizes a picture from its experience seeing millions of other pictures. the result is a synthograph (meaning synthetic drawing). With these synthographs we can explore the Infinite Universe.\\n\\n\\n### Infinite Universe Alliance\\n\\nThe Infinite Universe Alliance is a collection of 10,000 unique Captains(and Gods!) that inhabit the Infinite Universe. The collection was created using a structured prompt with distinct elements that determine the NFT\'s attributes. We have spent over 400 hours of computing time and picked each output individually to imagine impossible and unique Superheroes, Supervillains and Gods that create a rich internal narrative that you can build on as you please.\\n\\nWe hope that this sets the stage for the community to collectively create a galaxy of stories in which these entities strive for survival, control and expansion throughout the Infinite Universe\\n\\n\\n\\n## How we did it\\n\\nIn order to create a cohesive collection we designed a structured prompt. Each part of the prompt is turned into a trait in the collection. In the table below we show some examples of how the prompts are structured.\\n\\n| [Type] | [Attributes] | [Modifiers]|[Faction] | [Allignment] | [Output]\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |-----|---|\\n| Captain     | \ud83d\udd2e \ud83d\udc0c     | robot | Superhero   |chaotic neutral|![](https://i.imgur.com/K96c1NM.jpg)\\n| Captain     | incredible   | warrior | Supervillian   |chaotic good|![](https://i.imgur.com/oyP6BoA.jpg)\\n| Captain     | :fire:star    | ---------------  |Superhero   |chaotic neutral|![](https://i.imgur.com/s796taW.jpg)\\n| God of      | :fire::banana:    | --------------- | ---------------   |chaotic neutral|![](https://i.imgur.com/QquxL2p.jpg)\\n\\n\\nWe started by determining whether it\'s a Captain or a God, then we chose their defining characteristics and the subject modifier. The subject modifiers were discovered in the process of generating thousands of variations. Examples of modifiers are robot, samurai, zombie. These keywords act as a filter for the AI which create a specific look that we can mix with the other portions of the prompt. \\n\\nTo maintain consistency, we divided all captains into either Superheroes or a Supervillains . Finally, we used the standard alignment chart made popular in tabletop RPG games to create a variety of unique outputs for each prompt. The result is a collection of 10,000 completely unique characters that share a consistent set of traits through which  many different power levels themes and styles are represented. \\n\\n## Built in Provenance\\n\\nA side effect of synthography is that every output contains a hash that corresponds to the Midjourney job ID that created it. This will also be encoded as an extra trait that will allow users to verify the provenance of the NFT down to the timestamp when it was created. The collection was generated over 10 days of nonstop spamming prompts between a few synthers that jammed off of each other ideas to create all the variety that we now present. Someone could determine who came up with the original zombie (Doug09 did) and then you can see them appear across the collection and become one of the features of the middle part of the generation. As more people joined in new concepts are included which are then explored by the group. Overall creating this collection has been an incredible experience in imagination, collaboration and creative expression.\\n\\n\\n## THIS IS NOT A METAVERSE, it\'s an Infinite Universe\\n\\n\\nThe NFT market is filled with projects selling you their \\"Metaverse\\". However, we believe that they\'re all wrong. A metaverse is a collection of universes you can traverse. We already live in the metaverse. It\'s made out of our base reality plus the Star Wars Universe, the Marvel Universe, the Bored Ape YC universe and so on. Maybe they dont know it, but they\'re all building their own Universe, which is a PART of THE Metaverse.\\n\\nThe purpose of the NFT collection is to establish a base cannon where all of the entities we created exist within the same Infinite Universe. That means that owning an NFT of this collection gives you the ability to tell a part of the story of the AI-U yourself. With synthography you can create an infinity of worlds, challenges and adventures for your character to explore. Collectively the sum of these stories will create the most awesome adventure ever told.\\n\\n## Links\\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/gMvN2S5Rpm\\n\\nWebpage: https://ai-universe.io/\\n\\nTwitter: [@AI_UniverseNFT](https://twitter.com/AI_UniverseNFT)\\n\\nNerdQuarters:https://y.at/\ud83e\udd13\u2709\ufe0f\ud83e\udd13"},{"id":"Nerd-Bogota","metadata":{"permalink":"/nerddao/blog/Nerd-Bogota","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/NerdBlog2.md","source":"@site/blog/NerdBlog2.md","title":"NerdBogota","description":"From all over the world Nerds have travelled to Bogota, Colombia to participate in the EthBogota hackathon and DevCon.

The hackathon has come to an end with over 900 hackers participating and over 200 projects made over a single weekend. It is the biggest hackathon ever in LatAm.\\n\\nThe main goal of these events is to connect Ethereans together and strenghen the community around creating cool stuff. I\'d like to share my experience so that buidlers who are on the fence about participating in these events can get a sense of how cool it is to get together and buidl with buidlers in the same buidling.\\n\\n\\nOnce you decide to go to a Hackathon you should start brainstorming about what you would like to buidl. It can literally be anything but I personally like to think about a specific problem i\'d like to solve. At first it may feel like a pretty daunting task. But the most important thing about these events is that you\'re not alone. If you cant come up with anything its time to talk to other people and see what theyre trying to build and join the team that you find the most interesting. Although you can hack solo, you have way better chances if you join up with others that can complent your skillset and bring new ideas into the project. \\n\\nEthGlobal.com runs the hackathon events like a well oiled machine. You have plenty of avenues to reach out and connect to other people and there are several mentors available alongisde with the teams that sponsor the event in order to get more people to use their stack. I met my team members through the discord chat and after a team building event early on. At the event itself you have infinite coffee and plenty of food to keep you going throughout the weekend. ALthough the internet does get shoddy at times with all the npm installs going on.\\n\\n#### Let the Hack Begin!\\n\\nOnce your team has been formed and the hackathon officially begins. Its off to the races. Every team has a different strategy, but there are some important things to consider. The goal of the event is to showcase an idea, not necesarily a production stage. You want to get to the proof of concept as soon as possible and then build extra functionalities on top. You can stay at the venue 24/7 and a big percentage of people do, but it is also important to pace youself so that you can do good presentations at the end. \\n\\nAn important thing to keep in mind is that you dont necesarly need to be a super coder to participate in these events. There is a lot of work to be done in any project around documentation, graphic design, product ideation and narrative that really makes a difference to make your project stand out. \\n\\nThe judging process for the hacks is very brief and you dont really get too much time to go over small details, so its important to get straight to the point and try to have a long lasting impression. At the end of the day the Hackathon is not about winning but rather sharing ideas and connecting to people. I hope more Nerds will start participating in these events soon. Here is our submission to the hackathon.

The singular most impactful use case for blockchains is to serve as money. Money has three main characteristics: it serves as a store of value, as a medium of exchange, and as a unit of account. These three characteristics are not independent of each other since once any kind of money has value it can be used to fulfill those three functions. However, we can argue that there are some forms of money that are better than others at one of these aspects while lacking in others.\\n    \\n\\n### Crypto vs Fiat as a Medium of Echange\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n| Pros | Cons |\\n| -------- | -------- |\\n| Verifiable     | Costlier     | \\n| Uncensorable     | Slower     | \\n| Fungible     | Requires Onboarding     |\\n\\n</p>\\n\\n## Ranking of the online banking penetration in Latin America and the Caribbean by Country 2020\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lIYjU3m.png)\\n\\n# Smartphone penetration in Latin America\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xTsQA8c.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n\\n\\n# How to leapfrog LatAm over Online Banking into Web3?\\n\\n# Do what Online Banking couldn\'t:\\n\\n    \\n### Replace fiat paper.\\n ### With Crypto Paper\\n    \\n\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VauTrNE.jpg)\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eUGQ9bM.png)\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YS4jQBB.png)\\n    \\n</p>\\n\\n### Pitfalls ToDO & future work\\n\\n1) Protect claims from frontrunning when supplying private & public key\\n    \\n    - Future hash commit the withdraw transaction (a la ENS)\\n    - ZK proof of ownership of secret pair for withrdrawal\\n2) Decentralize further by giving trusted community leaders the ability to issue new papers themselves\\n    - PolygonId based reputation enables issuing allowance\\n    - MPC to create a split secret that allows printing bills on regular printer at home\\n\\n\\n\\n#### How to scale: Decentralize the printer\\n\\n\u2192 Corner stores are at the heart of Latin American communities\\n\\n\u2192 Store owners already provide several financial services: Cash in checks, pay for utilities, mobile phone plans\\n\\n\u2192 A reputation system can be implemented to represent existing trust on-chain\\n\\n\u2192 Trusted store owners can print papers as a service for customers who then add their balance\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    \\n<img src=\\"https://i.imgur.com/jUQAHSy.png\\"/>\\n\\n</p>\\n\\nGithub: https://github.com/allyu-xyz\\n\\nJoin the Nerds: https://y.at/%F0%9F%A4%93%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%A4%93"},{"id":"Nerd-OS","metadata":{"permalink":"/nerddao/blog/Nerd-OS","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/NerdOS.md","source":"@site/blog/NerdOS.md","title":"NerdOs Delegation Proposal","description":"Introduction","date":"2022-10-01T02:08:01.000Z","formattedDate":"October 1, 2022","tags":[{"label":"nerddao","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/nerddao"},{"label":"EthOs","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/eth-os"}],"readingTime":4.91,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Nerd-OS","title":"NerdOs Delegation Proposal","authors":{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"},"tags":["nerddao","EthOs"]},"prevItem":{"title":"NerdBogota","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/Nerd-Bogota"},"nextItem":{"title":"Building a Crypto Perpetual Motion Machine","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/perpetual-motion"}},"content":"##  Introduction\\n\\nWhat is Nerd DAO?\\n\\nNerd DAO is a post-work collective of highly capable individuals who gather to talk about anything related to being a Nerd. we tend to talk about cryptocurrencies and the latest developments in science art technology politics and economics. everyone is welcome and its free to join as long as you stay nerdy.\\n\\n A word about myself. I\'m known online as At0x.eth. Before being in crypto I became a M.D but took interest in data science and worked with a research group publishing several papers. Basically, I have always been a huge nerd. I used to play countless hours of WoW as a kid and have been running VR side hustles for over 5 years now. \\n<center>\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://giphy.com/embed/xghFgmOKbk0G4\\" width=\\"480\\" height=\\"321\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" class=\\"giphy-embed\\" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\\"https://giphy.com/gifs/smiling-spongebob-squarepants-nerd-xghFgmOKbk0G4\\">via GIPHY</a></p>\\n\\n</center>\\n\\n\\nI\'ve been aware of blockchain for a long time but did only start participating around june 2020 because covid made me reconsider my carreer choice. When I first joined into crypto telegram madness, I found there was no room for deep technical discourse if it was not related to a \\"when pump\\" statement. In a space where \\"in it for the technology\\" is used as a joke I needed to create a group where we\'re really in it for the tech. a place for Nerds.\\n\\n## Enter The NerdQuarters \\nhttps://y.at/\ud83e\udd13\u2709\ufe0f\ud83e\udd13\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MantluU.jpg)\\n\\nThe Nerdquarters is the core of the Nerd community. We have created an open source community where nerds come and share information to make sense of it together. It is also a place for newcomers to ask questions and avoid repeating the same mistakes we\'ve already learned from.\\n\\n\\nAs we have grown we have started to interact with alot of new tools for decentralized communities which have allowed us to coordinate to embark on several ventures. We dont need venture capital money because we do everything in house. We just want to have fun and experience the growth of the infinite machine. \\n\\n\\n## NERD DAO\\n\\nThe Nerd DAO is the on chain representation of the NERD commuinity. We created the DAO using [EthOS](https://ethos.eth.link).  EthOS is a permissionless and decentralized governance protocol that allows anyone to create their own DAO with its own token, treasury and governance interface. We are one of the earliest external users of EthOS. \\n\\nThe Nerd DAO is not explicitly intended to be a for profit venture. The initial tokens were airdropped to members of the telegram chat. Over 80% of the supply is still held by the Treasury wallet. There are no insider backers and nobody has special privileges or access over the token. Furthermore the NERD Treasury owns the initial LP used for the token. However, we have undertaken for profit ventures in the form of products and services such as our Nerd Fungible Trust group investment and our upcoming [Redacted] trading platform which will pay fees to the DAO.\\n\\nThrough all these ventures and experiences we have learned a thing or two about how the metaverse is being built. We have also started to etch our own corned of the metaverse by starting to interconnect experiences and information through Web3 interfaces. As our network becomes more expansive we\'re starting to learn what the metaverse really is and how its different from the way we used to do things. As proof, here\'s a picture of our latest development meeting for one of our projects.\\n<center>\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EzihW4B.png)\\n</center>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Nerd DAO  Metaverse Manifesto\\n\\n- We believe that the Metaverse is a series of interconected experiences through which an individual can traverse while preserving their identity. \\n    - In that context we believe that the role of the Nerd DAO is to create and connect experiences for its members to traverse. We are here to buidl our corner of the Metaverse.\\n\\n- We believe that a metaverse is a place for human connection and therefore our goal is to make it enticing for people to inhabit our spaces in order to collaborate, play and learn together.\\n\\n- We know that the metaverse HAS to be fun. If the metaverse feels like work, you\'re not doing it right.\\n\\nNerd has no papers of incorporation, no headquarters, nor even a list of names and locations for its contributors\\n\\nWe follow [Yearn\'s](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1445799269189881864?s=20) radical decentralization model. Which means that anyone can join up our community and contribute. Join the Nerdquarters chat! We are always talking about the daily happenings and there\'s plenty of people eager to explain away any questions others may have. Once you are there you can join our development groups or create your own and recieve help and guidance from the other nerds on how to apply your time to start your crypto adventure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Nerds <3 EthOS\\n\\nThe purpose of the NERD delegation for ETHOs will be to create venues and opportunities to showcase the power of the ETHOS protocol as a tool to build an online community. By creating forkable products that solve different challenges nerds face (such as trustless bitcoin bridges or AI NFTs) we can increase useage of the EthOS protocol by enhancing the smart contract  landscape of the base layer [what a sentence!!]\\n\\nAdittionaly NerdDAO will spearhead the organization of a recurrent hackathon and digital event to showcase and support projects built with the EthOS stack. We will demonstrate how different problems can be solved using the codebase and have a dev team trained to create front ends for contracts deployed using EthOS factories.\\n\\n\\n## Scope of the NERD Delegation\\n\\nThe purpose of the NERD delegation is to showcase EthereansOS protocol asa a tool to build decentralized communities. this includes several avenues:\\n\\n1) Utilizing and showcasing the use of EthOS protocol on products developed by Nerd\\n2) Creating a starter kit to simplify developing interfaces with EthOS products\\n3) Organizing events to communicate the goals of the protocol, create products that leverage the EthOS stack and showcase products and communities built on it"},{"id":"perpetual-motion","metadata":{"permalink":"/nerddao/blog/perpetual-motion","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/crypto-perpetual-motion-machine.md","source":"@site/blog/crypto-perpetual-motion-machine.md","title":"Building a Crypto Perpetual Motion Machine","description":"\\"Oh ye seekers after perpetual motion, how many vain chimeras have you pursued?

Go and take your place with the alchemists.\\"*** \\n\\n\u2014\u2009Leonardo da Vinci, 1494\\n\\nPerpetual motion is the motion of bodies that ***continues forever in an unperturbed system. A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that can do work infinitely without an external energy source.*** This kind of machine is impossible, as it would violate either the first or second law of thermodynamics or both.\\n\\nLuckily for us we\'re dealing with the laws of crypto economics, not thermodynamics. The behavior of monetary systems can in fact be modeled using Physic\'s first principles and the inmaterial nature of it allows for the creation of systems that go beyon the constraints of the phisical world. However, the laws of thermodiamics offer a glimpse of what is required to create an infinitely sustainable monetary system, which in fact is a perpetual motion machine.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n***The first law*** describes the of conservation of energy states postulating that the total energy of any isolated system (for which energy and matter transfer through the system boundary are not possible) is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed.\\n\\n***The second law*** may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium where the entropy is highest at the given internal energy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Money is a form of Energy\\n\\nIn physics, ***energy*** is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes. In other words, both money and energy can be described as a quantitative property that is transfered in exchange for work. Unlike energy however, money can in fact be created and destroyed. Which is the first key we need to create a perpetual motion machine\\n\\n## Can Entropy be Reduced?\\n\\n***\u201cTHERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\u201d***\\n\\n-Multivac, 2061\\n\\n***Entropy*** is a scientific concept as well as a measurable physical property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. In the phisical world the overall entropy always increases: things tend to go from a state of order to disorder if left unchecked. Although the total entropy of the universe cannot ever decrease energy (read: money) can be spent to fight off entropy locally. Thats why we eat food in order and reduce our body entropy by repairing and replacing cells. Ultimately however, in the physical world entropy always wins. \\n\\n## Entropy Reduction = Value Creation\\n\\nImagine you could deploy custom laws of physics. Thats what solidity is like. If entropy is a measure of unceartanty smart contracts are anti-entropy devices for they describe deterministic functions that organize energy(read: money). For example; The UniSwap smart contracts organize thousands of pairs from houndreds of thousands of users in order to allow atomic swaps between any asset pair. The fact that UniSwap is deployed in the network reduces the total entropy and increased the value of everything within.\\n\\nIn the case of StrudelDAO our source of entropy is the vBTC peg. Our protocol aims to reduce this entropy by deploying incentive structures that produce energy (read: money) in order to incentivize actions that achieve this goal. Once we manage to achieve the peg we know that value will have ben created for the protocol which we can compound on by offering a product that can be built upon by other protocols which are also creating on chain value. \\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/X0iDfFy.png)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ycdmrfp.png)\\n\\n\\n## the Strudel Bitcoin Metabolism\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yoDN0iB.png)\\n\\nThe above graphic is a schematic of an enzimatic pathway. In Biological systems enzimatic pathways are a series of chemical reactions that transform a molecule for a specific purpose. Aditionally, enzimes are interoperable and often have multiple uses throughout the body. Furthermore, enzimatic processes often trigger multiple other processes downstream to create complex behaviours found throughout nature.\\n\\nThe Strudel Protocol employs a similar approach to the design of the incentive scheme for the vBTC peg. In order to produce a pegged Bitcoin asset the protocol employs multiple incentive mechanisms in multiple chains to create complex arbitrage patterns that peg vBTC to the Bitcoin price. \\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9z9ZRlc.png)\\n\\n### Entering the Strudel\\nThe strudel protocol creates an incentive for users to bridge BTC into the ethereum network due to an arbitrage between the vBTC price and BTC price. The price of vBTC is determined by the existing liquidity. Whenever vBTC is above the peg new coins are minted to close the arbitrage. Once inside the ETH network users can use their vBTC in a variety of yield farming oppportunities to earn $TRDL tokens. \\n\\n\\nThe current deployed components of the protocol interacting with vBTC are:\\n\\n* ETH\\n    * Strudel Protocol\\n        * Bridge Contracts\\n        * MasterChef yield farm\\n* Bridge\\n    * Multichain.xyz\\n        * ETH<->FTM bridge\\n* FTM\\n    * ORKAN\\n        * Bonds\\n            * vBTC\\n            * $M\\n    * MitiCushqui\\n        * Stablecoin\\n            * $M\\n\\n### Orkanization\\n\\nIn the FTM network, ORKAN offers perpetual bonds offering Orkan tokens for vBTC and $M which generate consistent buying pressure for vBTC which pulls tokens from the Ethereum network into Fantom. Orkan aims to create the largest on chain BTC repository and removes vBTC from circulation, reducing the floating circulating supply and increasing the mainnet vBTC price. At the same time, the reserves acquired will be deployed in order to obtain interest bearing opportunities for $M and vBTC holders throughout the FTM DeFi ecosystem\\n\\n### Back to Basics: BTC Backed Reserve Currency\\n\\nThe last piece of the puzzle is our stablecoin issuing procotol: [mitiCushqui\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5](https://y.at/\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5). This protocol issues a stablecoin backed by USDC and vBTC. We created an oracle that pegs vBTC to the BTC price effectively creating an arbitrage that will mint $M at a discount and redeem for $USDC as long as vBTC is under the peg.  Once the arbitrage is closed $M issuance will serve as a backstop to preserve the vBTC peg as the BTC price varies. \\n\\n### Perpetual Motion\\n\\nThe incentive structures decribed above should generate perpetual motion by creating a system which tends to return equilibrium point where vBTC is pegged to the BTC price.  If such state of homeostasis is achieved the system would go on forever mantaining a stable peg for a growing vBTC market. The implications of this scenario for the Strudel Protocol are inmense: \\n* Strudel could secure a significant portion of the BTC network for the DeFi ecosystem forever. Merging BTC and DeFI irreversively.  \\n* ORKAN would become the biggest on chain decentralized repository of BTC. \\n* $M would become one of the most reliable reserve currencies in DeFi, serving as a base asset for many other community specific stable assets."},{"id":"what-is-nerd","metadata":{"permalink":"/nerddao/blog/what-is-nerd","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/what-is-NERD.md","source":"@site/blog/what-is-NERD.md","title":"What is \ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd13?","description":"Introduction","date":"2022-10-01T02:08:01.000Z","formattedDate":"October 1, 2022","tags":[{"label":"nerddao","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/nerddao"}],"readingTime":3.985,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"what-is-nerd","title":"What is \ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd13?","authors":{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"},"tags":["nerddao"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Building a Crypto Perpetual Motion Machine","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/perpetual-motion"},"nextItem":{"title":"Strudel Bitcoin Investment Briefing","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/strudel-briefing"}},"content":"##  Introduction\\n\\nWhat is NerdDAO\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd13?\\n\\nIn principle, it\'s a newsletter that\'s going to try and record NerdDAO Activity. Instead of \\"publishing\\" a periodical this is going to be a long form series of articles which can be accessed through https://y.at/\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd13. I\'m going to try and get notable members of the Nerdquarters to contribute on a varied range of subjects. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n A word about myself. I\'m known online as At0x.eth. Before being in crypto I became a M.D but took interest in data science and worked with a research group publishing several papers. Basically, I have always been a huge nerd. I used to play countless hours of WoW as a kid and have been running VR side hustles for over 5 years now. \\n<center>\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://giphy.com/embed/xghFgmOKbk0G4\\" width=\\"480\\" height=\\"321\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" class=\\"giphy-embed\\" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\\"https://giphy.com/gifs/smiling-spongebob-squarepants-nerd-xghFgmOKbk0G4\\">via GIPHY</a></p>\\n\\n</center>\\n\\n\\nI\'ve been aware of blockchain for a long time but did only start participating around june 2020 because covid made me reconsider my carreer choice. When I first joined into crypto telegram madness, I found there was no room for deep technical discourse if it was not related to a \\"when pump\\" statement. In a space where \\"in it for the technology\\" is used as a joke I needed to create a group where we\'re really in it for the tech. a place for Nerds.\\n\\n## Enter The NerdQuarters \\nhttps://y.at/\ud83e\udd13\u2709\ufe0f\ud83e\udd13\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MantluU.jpg)\\n\\nThe Nerdquarters is the core of the Nerd community. We have created an open source community where nerds come and share information to make sense of it together. It is also a place for newcomers to ask questions and avoid repeating the same mistakes we\'ve already learned from.\\n\\n\\nAs we have grown we have started to interact with alot of new tools for decentralized communities which have allowed us to coordinate to embark on several ventures. We dont need venture capital money because we do everything in house. We just want to have fun and experience the growth of the infinite machine. \\n\\n\\n## NERD DAO\\n\\nThe Nerd DAO is the on chain representation of the NERD commuinity. We created the DAO using [EthOS](https://ethos.eth.link).  EthOS is a permissionless and decentralized governance protocol that allows anyone to create their own DAO with its own token, treasury and governance interface. We are one of the earliest external users of EthOS. \\n\\nThe Nerd DAO is not explicitly intended to be a for profit venture. The initial tokens were airdropped to members of the telegram chat. Over 80% of the supply is still held by the Treasury wallet. There are no insider backers and nobody has special privileges or access over the token. Furthermore the NERD Treasury owns the initial LP used for the token. However, we have undertaken for profit ventures in the form of products and services such as our Nerd Fungible Trust group investment and our upcoming [Redacted] trading platform which will pay fees to the DAO.\\n\\nThrough all these ventures and experiences we have learned a thing or two about how the metaverse is being built. We have also started to etch our own corned of the metaverse by starting to interconnect experiences and information through Web3 interfaces. As our network becomes more expansive we\'re starting to learn what the metaverse really is and how its different from the way we used to do things. As proof, here\'s a picture of our latest development meeting for one of our projects.\\n<center>\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EzihW4B.png)\\n</center>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Nerd DAO  Metaverse Manifesto\\n\\n- ***We believe that the Metaverse is a series of interconected experiences through which an individual can traverse while preserving their identity. ***\\n    - In that context we believe that the role of the Nerd DAO is to create and connect experiences for its members to traverse. We are here to buidl our corner of the Metaverse.\\n\\n- ***We believe that a metaverse is a place for human connection and therefore our goal is to make it enticing for people to inhabit our spaces in order to collaborate, play and learn together.***\\n\\n- ***We know that the metaverse HAS to be fun. If the metaverse feels like work, we\'re not there yet.***\\n\\n\\n## How To Participate?\\n\\nQ: Who can contribute to Nerd?\\n\\nA: You\\n\\nNerd has no papers of incorporation, no headquarters, nor even a list of names and locations for its contributors\\n\\nWe follow [Yearn\'s](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1445799269189881864?s=20) radical decentralization model. Which means that anyone can join up our community and contribute. Join the Nerdquarters chat!

This one-of-a-kind economic approach offers average users and big money investors numerous options for monetary growth and grants more diversity and security to DeFi.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n# Problem Statement\\n\\n**Bitcoin**  is poorly incorporated into web3. The existing landscape relies mainly on wBTC, a trusted bridge operated primarily by funds such as 3AC, which have the exclusive right to mint and burn wBTC, therefore cornering the benefit of the arbitrage between on-chain BTC and legacy markets.\\n\\nVitalik [has stated](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1295252403558559746?s=20&t=UvAU_6bfaNeaIVcafixefg) that trusted BTC bridges pose a systemic risk to the DeFi ecosystem. I would go even further and say that DeFi cannot grow until its intimately integrated with BTC and we capture a significant % of the BTC network on-chain. To achieve this goal, we must find a robust solution to bridge many BTC into the Web3 economy.\\n\\n\\n \\n## The On Chain Bitcoin Landscape\\n\\n[Updated Dashboard](https://dune.com/eliasimos/btc-on-ethereum_1)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AyKNaM9.png)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vYAyc5x.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n- Less than 1.5% of the BTC supply is currently bridged on-chain.\\n- On-chain, BTC balances are very stable compared to price volatility.\\n- Trusted bridges (wBTC+hBTC) represent over 90% of all the BTC bridged on-chain.\\n- Decentralized alternatives have not found strong PmF: RenBTC only has 4,000 BTC bridged. Hardly 2% of the total on-chain BTC\\n\\n\\n## Strudel Bridge Architecture\\n\\nWhen BTC is requested to be transferred using the Strudel dApp, a transaction output with the transfer amount and the receiving Ethereum wallet address is created. This output is handed to the user\u2019s Bitcoin wallet through the QR code. When a user signs a transfer, the resulting transaction might look like this.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eGRRlhh.png)\\n\\nNext, the header of the Bitcoin block containing the transaction needs to be registered in the relayer contract on Ethereum, where its proof-of-work is verified, and the canonical chain is extended. Simple payment verification (SPV), a protocol used by Bitcoin light clients and wallets, prevents invalid blocks from entering the relayer.\\nOnce the transaction containing the burn has been buried under enough proof of work (6 blocks), an inclusion proof is relayed onto Ethereum. The proof is verified by the Strudel contract, which mints vBTC in a ratio of 1:1 to the designated Ethereum address. The protocol strictly mints one vBTC for one burned BTC, not taking any fees for bridge crossings.\\n\\n## Strudel Bitcoin\\n\\nToken Address: 0xe1406825186d63980fd6e2ec61888f7b91c4bae4\\n\\nCurrent vBTC Supply: 23.27238764 \\n\\nToken Distribution:\\n\\nHodlers: 461 \\n\\nTotal Liquidity: ~120,000 USD combined\\n\\nMarket Cap: 230,000 USD\\n\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/llQkTCg.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce BTC crosses the bridge using the Strudel Protocol its issued as Strudel Bitcoin (vBTC) on the Ethereum network. vBTC is **fully erc20 compliant** with 18 decimals and flash loan capabilities. \\n\\nhttps://etherscan.io/token/0xe1406825186d63980fd6e2ec61888f7b91c4bae4\\nhttps://ftmscan.com/token/0x9049198f6b21acf1e050cfcf36a6879a07b0bbe4\\n\\n### Historic Performance\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vVcjWIe.png)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/c5Jhu6c.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n- vBTC has outperformed both ETH (+86%) and BTC (+53%) YTD\\n- The Strudel Protocol controls > 50% of vBTC, which are acquired through Orkan.Finance bond issuance and MitiCushqui stablecoin issuance.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Liquidity landscape\\n\\nStrudel utilizes a [mandate based approach](https://app.gitbook.com/o/V40TVngLYntzpq24zWhI/s/9QESb5e46FBDH1t8kShd/monetary-policy/mandates) to guide the development of the protocol\\n\\n**Mandate #1 - Achieve true decentralization of BTC on DeFi\\nMandate #2  - Design incentive structures that issue and manage reserve backed currencies**\\n\\nBy utilizing vBTC as a reserve asset, we reduce the floating supply and therefore provide price stability when interacting with demand driven by incentives to provide liquidity for vBTC\\n\\n**Liquidity Incentives**\\n\\nThe first stop for vBTC once bridged is the strudel. Finance farms. The protocol utilizes a sushi-style LP farm to issue 1 $TRDL per block split evenly among the following positions:\\n\\n- $TRDL:ETH(Pool0) (320%APY)\\n- vBTC:$TRDL (73.51%APY)\\n- vBTC:ETH (14.96%APY)\\n- vNFT::vBTC:PUNK:CC:BAYC (NA* APY)\\n\\n*have to develop code to calculate price on multi asset pool to use in APY formula. \\n\\n**Reserve Backed Currencies**\\n\\n**Orkan.finance**\\n\\n**$vBTC\'s peg through The Orkan** \\n- When $vBTC gets under the peg, $ORK bonds are issued to increase the treasury supply and therefore remove $vBTC from circulation\\n- When $vBTC gets above the peg, previously acquired $vBTC is exchanged by the protocol for other assets to diversify the treasury basket or to buy back and burn $ORK.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b2V7Yoo.png)\\n\\n**vBTC as a Store of Value**\\n\\nThe Orkan treasury has managed to retain most of the value issued for the purchase of vBTC even though the market has gone through a significant downturn. ORK is trading at .40c, whereas the backing per token is 1.22c.\\n\\n**\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5MitiCushqui\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5**\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/axrQqVG.png)\\n\\n\\nWe recently deployed MitiCushqui, a [stablecoin issuing protocol](https://y.at/\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5). This protocol can be used to deploy redeemable stablecoins backed by a fixed ratio of a base stablecoin and any other asset. \\n\\nThe protocol oracles the BTC price and therefore creates an arbitrage where users can mint $Miti  at a discount and redeem for USDC. The vault keeps vBTC out of circulation therefore reducing the supply and increasing the price until the arbitrage is closed and the peg is met. \\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UC5UXFw.png)\\n\\n## The Future of Bitcoin is on-chain and the on-chain future is Bitcoin.\\n\\nTo make the web3 ecosystem more robust, we need to onboard a more significant percentage of BTC on-chain. A way to achieve reliable yields is to incentivize the flow of BTC into Web3. This capital can finance projects that generate value for the entire space. This makes BTC more useful, which is vital For it to gain mainstream adoption.\\n\\nThe future of BTC cannot depend on any one group of developers or caretakers. To realize its potential, we must find ways to bridge it into the Web3 ecosystem by utilizing as many techniques as possible and later building tools to create an interoperable interface\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn More:\\n\\nStrudel Twitter: @EnterTheStrudel\\nAt0x Twitter: @At0xNQ\\nNerd Chat: https://y.at/\ud83e\udd13\u2709\ufe0f\ud83e\udd13\\nStrudel Landing: https://y.at/\ud83c\udf2a\ud83c\udf2a\ud83d\udc40\\nMitiCushqui: https://y.at/\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5"}]}')}}]);
