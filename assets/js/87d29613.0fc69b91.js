The hackathon has come to an end with over 900 hackers participating and over 200 projects made over a single weekend. It is the biggest hackathon ever in LatAm.\\n\\nThe main goal of these events is to connect Ethereans together and strenghen the community around creating cool stuff. I\'d like to share my experience so that buidlers who are on the fence about participating in these events can get a sense of how cool it is to get together and buidl with buidlers in the same buidling.\\n\\n\\nOnce you decide to go to a Hackathon you should start brainstorming about what you would like to buidl. It can literally be anything but I personally like to think about a specific problem i\'d like to solve. At first it may feel like a pretty daunting task. But the most important thing about these events is that you\'re not alone. If you cant come up with anything its time to talk to other people and see what theyre trying to build and join the team that you find the most interesting. Although you can hack solo, you have way better chances if you join up with others that can complent your skillset and bring new ideas into the project. \\n\\nEthGlobal.com runs the hackathon events like a well oiled machine. You have plenty of avenues to reach out and connect to other people and there are several mentors available alongisde with the teams that sponsor the event in order to get more people to use their stack. I met my team members through the discord chat and after a team building event early on. At the event itself you have infinite coffee and plenty of food to keep you going throughout the weekend. ALthough the internet does get shoddy at times with all the npm installs going on.\\n\\n#### Let the Hack Begin!\\n\\nOnce your team has been formed and the hackathon officially begins. Its off to the races. Every team has a different strategy, but there are some important things to consider. The goal of the event is to showcase an idea, not necesarily a production stage. You want to get to the proof of concept as soon as possible and then build extra functionalities on top. You can stay at the venue 24/7 and a big percentage of people do, but it is also important to pace youself so that you can do good presentations at the end. \\n\\nAn important thing to keep in mind is that you dont necesarly need to be a super coder to participate in these events. There is a lot of work to be done in any project around documentation, graphic design, product ideation and narrative that really makes a difference to make your project stand out. \\n\\nThe judging process for the hacks is very brief and you dont really get too much time to go over small details, so its important to get straight to the point and try to have a long lasting impression. At the end of the day the Hackathon is not about winning but rather sharing ideas and connecting to people. I hope more Nerds will start participating in these events soon. Here is our submission to the hackathon. If you find it interesting and would like to help out with this idea feel free to reach out at the NerdQuarters.\\n<center>\\n    \\n# [Allyu.xyz ](https://Allyu.xyz )\\n    \\n  ![](https://i.imgur.com/cikwHhm.png)\\n\\n\\n## A community-based protocol to issue crypto-backed money\\n    \\n</center>\\n\\n### Objectives: \\n\\n- To create a system that communities can leverage to issue their own trustless paper money backed entirely by crypto deposits.\\n- Onboard community leaders into crypto and enable them to lead by example in the adoption of web3.\\n- To increase the transactability of Ethereum based products by introducing them into the heart of the Latin American community: the corner store. allowing recipients to purchase food and other vital supplies with crypto money\\n\\n.\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\n    \\nIn order to gain mass adoption, Web3 protocols need to start with the simplest use cases in order to address the needs of a majority of the world\'s population. The singular most impactful use case for blockchains is to serve as money. Money has three main characteristics: it serves as a store of value, as a medium of exchange, and as a unit of account. These three characteristics are not independent of each other since once any kind of money has value it can be used to fulfill those three functions. However, we can argue that there are some forms of money that are better than others at one of these aspects while lacking in others.\\n    \\n\\n### Crypto vs Fiat as a Medium of Echange\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n| Pros | Cons |\\n| -------- | -------- |\\n| Verifiable     | Costlier     | \\n| Uncensorable     | Slower     | \\n| Fungible     | Requires Onboarding     |\\n\\n</p>\\n\\n## Ranking of the online banking penetration in Latin America and the Caribbean by Country 2020\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lIYjU3m.png)\\n\\n# Smartphone penetration in Latin America\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xTsQA8c.png)\\n\\n<center>\\n\\n\\n\\n# How to leapfrog LatAm over Online Banking into Web3?\\n\\n# Do what Online Banking couldn\'t:\\n\\n    \\n### Replace fiat paper.\\n ### With Crypto Paper\\n    \\n\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VauTrNE.jpg)\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eUGQ9bM.png)\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YS4jQBB.png)\\n    \\n</center>\\n\\n### Pitfalls ToDO & future work\\n\\n1) Protect claims from frontrunning when supplying private & public key\\n    \\n    - Future hash commit the withdraw transaction (a la ENS)\\n    - ZK proof of ownership of secret pair for withrdrawal\\n2) Decentralize further by giving trusted community leaders the ability to issue new papers themselves\\n    - PolygonId based reputation enables issuing allowance\\n    - MPC to create a split secret that allows printing bills on regular printer at home\\n\\n\\n\\n#### How to scale: Decentralize the printer\\n\\n\u2192 Corner stores are at the heart of Latin American communities\\n\\n\u2192 Store owners already provide several financial services: Cash in checks, pay for utilities, mobile phone plans\\n\\n\u2192 A reputation system can be implemented to represent existing trust on-chain\\n\\n\u2192 Trusted store owners can print papers as a service for customers who then add their balance\\n<center>\\n    \\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jUQAHSy.png)\\n</center>\\n\\nGithub: https://github.com/allyu-xyz\\nJoin the Nerds: https://y.at/%F0%9F%A4%93%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%A4%93"},{"id":"/NerdOS","metadata":{"permalink":"/nerddao/blog/NerdOS","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/NerdOS.md","source":"@site/blog/NerdOS.md","title":"Nerd DAO Delegation proposal","description":"Introduction","date":"2022-10-01T02:08:01.000Z","formattedDate":"October 1, 2022","tags":[],"readingTime":4.91,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"prevItem":{"title":"NerdBogota","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/Nerd-Bogota"},"nextItem":{"title":"Building a Crypto Perpetual Motion Machine","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/perpetual-motion"}},"content":"##  Introduction\\n\\nWhat is Nerd DAO?\\n\\nNerd DAO is a post-work collective of highly capable individuals who gather to talk about anything related to being a Nerd. we tend to talk about cryptocurrencies and the latest developments in science art technology politics and economics. everyone is welcome and its free to join as long as you stay nerdy.\\n\\n A word about myself.

Go and take your place with the alchemists.\\"*** \\n\\n\u2014\u2009Leonardo da Vinci, 1494\\n\\nPerpetual motion is the motion of bodies that ***continues forever in an unperturbed system. A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that can do work infinitely without an external energy source.*** This kind of machine is impossible, as it would violate either the first or second law of thermodynamics or both.\\n\\nLuckily for us we\'re dealing with the laws of crypto economics, not thermodynamics. The behavior of monetary systems can in fact be modeled using Physic\'s first principles and the inmaterial nature of it allows for the creation of systems that go beyon the constraints of the phisical world. However, the laws of thermodiamics offer a glimpse of what is required to create an infinitely sustainable monetary system, which in fact is a perpetual motion machine.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n***The first law*** describes the of conservation of energy states postulating that the total energy of any isolated system (for which energy and matter transfer through the system boundary are not possible) is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed.\\n\\n***The second law*** may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium where the entropy is highest at the given internal energy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Money is a form of Energy\\n\\nIn physics, ***energy*** is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes. In other words, both money and energy can be described as a quantitative property that is transfered in exchange for work. Unlike energy however, money can in fact be created and destroyed. Which is the first key we need to create a perpetual motion machine\\n\\n## Can Entropy be Reduced?\\n\\n***\u201cTHERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\u201d***\\n\\n-Multivac, 2061\\n\\n***Entropy*** is a scientific concept as well as a measurable physical property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. In the phisical world the overall entropy always increases: things tend to go from a state of order to disorder if left unchecked. Although the total entropy of the universe cannot ever decrease energy (read: money) can be spent to fight off entropy locally. Thats why we eat food in order and reduce our body entropy by repairing and replacing cells. Ultimately however, in the physical world entropy always wins. \\n\\n## Entropy Reduction = Value Creation\\n\\nImagine you could deploy custom laws of physics. Thats what solidity is like. If entropy is a measure of unceartanty smart contracts are anti-entropy devices for they describe deterministic functions that organize energy(read: money). For example; The UniSwap smart contracts organize thousands of pairs from houndreds of thousands of users in order to allow atomic swaps between any asset pair. The fact that UniSwap is deployed in the network reduces the total entropy and increased the value of everything within.\\n\\nIn the case of StrudelDAO our source of entropy is the vBTC peg. Our protocol aims to reduce this entropy by deploying incentive structures that produce energy (read: money) in order to incentivize actions that achieve this goal. Once we manage to achieve the peg we know that value will have ben created for the protocol which we can compound on by offering a product that can be built upon by other protocols which are also creating on chain value. \\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/X0iDfFy.png)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ycdmrfp.png)\\n\\n\\n## the Strudel Bitcoin Metabolism\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yoDN0iB.png)\\n\\nThe above graphic is a schematic of an enzimatic pathway. In Biological systems enzimatic pathways are a series of chemical reactions that transform a molecule for a specific purpose. Aditionally, enzimes are interoperable and often have multiple uses throughout the body. Furthermore, enzimatic processes often trigger multiple other processes downstream to create complex behaviours found throughout nature.\\n\\nThe Strudel Protocol employs a similar approach to the design of the incentive scheme for the vBTC peg. In order to produce a pegged Bitcoin asset the protocol employs multiple incentive mechanisms in multiple chains to create complex arbitrage patterns that peg vBTC to the Bitcoin price. \\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9z9ZRlc.png)\\n\\n### Entering the Strudel\\nThe strudel protocol creates an incentive for users to bridge BTC into the ethereum network due to an arbitrage between the vBTC price and BTC price. The price of vBTC is determined by the existing liquidity. Whenever vBTC is above the peg new coins are minted to close the arbitrage. Once inside the ETH network users can use their vBTC in a variety of yield farming oppportunities to earn $TRDL tokens. \\n\\n\\nThe current deployed components of the protocol interacting with vBTC are:\\n\\n* ETH\\n    * Strudel Protocol\\n        * Bridge Contracts\\n        * MasterChef yield farm\\n* Bridge\\n    * Multichain.xyz\\n        * ETH<->FTM bridge\\n* FTM\\n    * ORKAN\\n        * Bonds\\n            * vBTC\\n            * $M\\n    * MitiCushqui\\n        * Stablecoin\\n            * $M\\n\\n### Orkanization\\n\\nIn the FTM network, ORKAN offers perpetual bonds offering Orkan tokens for vBTC and $M which generate consistent buying pressure for vBTC which pulls tokens from the Ethereum network into Fantom. Orkan aims to create the largest on chain BTC repository and removes vBTC from circulation, reducing the floating circulating supply and increasing the mainnet vBTC price. At the same time, the reserves acquired will be deployed in order to obtain interest bearing opportunities for $M and vBTC holders throughout the FTM DeFi ecosystem\\n\\n### Back to Basics: BTC Backed Reserve Currency\\n\\nThe last piece of the puzzle is our stablecoin issuing procotol: [mitiCushqui\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5](https://y.at/\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5). This protocol issues a stablecoin backed by USDC and vBTC. We created an oracle that pegs vBTC to the BTC price effectively creating an arbitrage that will mint $M at a discount and redeem for $USDC as long as vBTC is under the peg.  Once the arbitrage is closed $M issuance will serve as a backstop to preserve the vBTC peg as the BTC price varies. \\n\\n### Perpetual Motion\\n\\nThe incentive structures decribed above should generate perpetual motion by creating a system which tends to return equilibrium point where vBTC is pegged to the BTC price.  If such state of homeostasis is achieved the system would go on forever mantaining a stable peg for a growing vBTC market. The implications of this scenario for the Strudel Protocol are inmense: \\n* Strudel could secure a significant portion of the BTC network for the DeFi ecosystem forever. Merging BTC and DeFI irreversively.  \\n* ORKAN would become the biggest on chain decentralized repository of BTC. \\n* $M would become one of the most reliable reserve currencies in DeFi, serving as a base asset for many other community specific stable assets."},{"id":"what-is-nerd","metadata":{"permalink":"/nerddao/blog/what-is-nerd","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/what-is-NERD.md","source":"@site/blog/what-is-NERD.md","title":"What is \ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd13?","description":"Introduction","date":"2022-10-01T02:08:01.000Z","formattedDate":"October 1, 2022","tags":[{"label":"nerddao","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/tags/nerddao"}],"readingTime":3.985,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"what-is-nerd","title":"What is \ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd13?","authors":{"name":"At0x","title":"chief nerd"},"tags":["nerddao"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Building a Crypto Perpetual Motion Machine","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/perpetual-motion"},"nextItem":{"title":"Strudel Bitcoin Investment Briefing","permalink":"/nerddao/blog/strudel-briefing"}},"content":"##  Introduction\\n\\nWhat is NerdDAO\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd13?\\n\\nIn principle, it\'s a newsletter that\'s going to try and record NerdDAO Activity.

This one-of-a-kind economic approach offers average users and big money investors numerous options for monetary growth and grants more diversity and security to DeFi.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n# Problem Statement\\n\\n**Bitcoin**  is poorly incorporated into web3. The existing landscape relies mainly on wBTC, a trusted bridge operated primarily by funds such as 3AC, which have the exclusive right to mint and burn wBTC, therefore cornering the benefit of the arbitrage between on-chain BTC and legacy markets.\\n\\nVitalik [has stated](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1295252403558559746?s=20&t=UvAU_6bfaNeaIVcafixefg) that trusted BTC bridges pose a systemic risk to the DeFi ecosystem. I would go even further and say that DeFi cannot grow until its intimately integrated with BTC and we capture a significant % of the BTC network on-chain. To achieve this goal, we must find a robust solution to bridge many BTC into the Web3 economy.\\n\\n\\n \\n## The On Chain Bitcoin Landscape\\n\\n[Updated Dashboard](https://dune.com/eliasimos/btc-on-ethereum_1)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AyKNaM9.png)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vYAyc5x.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n- Less than 1.5% of the BTC supply is currently bridged on-chain.\\n- On-chain, BTC balances are very stable compared to price volatility.\\n- Trusted bridges (wBTC+hBTC) represent over 90% of all the BTC bridged on-chain.\\n- Decentralized alternatives have not found strong PmF: RenBTC only has 4,000 BTC bridged. Hardly 2% of the total on-chain BTC\\n\\n\\n## Strudel Bridge Architecture\\n\\nWhen BTC is requested to be transferred using the Strudel dApp, a transaction output with the transfer amount and the receiving Ethereum wallet address is created. This output is handed to the user\u2019s Bitcoin wallet through the QR code. When a user signs a transfer, the resulting transaction might look like this.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eGRRlhh.png)\\n\\nNext, the header of the Bitcoin block containing the transaction needs to be registered in the relayer contract on Ethereum, where its proof-of-work is verified, and the canonical chain is extended. Simple payment verification (SPV), a protocol used by Bitcoin light clients and wallets, prevents invalid blocks from entering the relayer.\\nOnce the transaction containing the burn has been buried under enough proof of work (6 blocks), an inclusion proof is relayed onto Ethereum. The proof is verified by the Strudel contract, which mints vBTC in a ratio of 1:1 to the designated Ethereum address. The protocol strictly mints one vBTC for one burned BTC, not taking any fees for bridge crossings.\\n\\n## Strudel Bitcoin\\n\\nToken Address: 0xe1406825186d63980fd6e2ec61888f7b91c4bae4\\n\\nCurrent vBTC Supply: 23.27238764 \\n\\nToken Distribution:\\n\\nHodlers: 461 \\n\\nTotal Liquidity: ~120,000 USD combined\\n\\nMarket Cap: 230,000 USD\\n\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/llQkTCg.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce BTC crosses the bridge using the Strudel Protocol its issued as Strudel Bitcoin (vBTC) on the Ethereum network. vBTC is **fully erc20 compliant** with 18 decimals and flash loan capabilities. \\n\\nhttps://etherscan.io/token/0xe1406825186d63980fd6e2ec61888f7b91c4bae4\\nhttps://ftmscan.com/token/0x9049198f6b21acf1e050cfcf36a6879a07b0bbe4\\n\\n### Historic Performance\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vVcjWIe.png)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/c5Jhu6c.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n- vBTC has outperformed both ETH (+86%) and BTC (+53%) YTD\\n- The Strudel Protocol controls > 50% of vBTC, which are acquired through Orkan.Finance bond issuance and MitiCushqui stablecoin issuance.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Liquidity landscape\\n\\nStrudel utilizes a [mandate based approach](https://app.gitbook.com/o/V40TVngLYntzpq24zWhI/s/9QESb5e46FBDH1t8kShd/monetary-policy/mandates) to guide the development of the protocol\\n\\n**Mandate #1 - Achieve true decentralization of BTC on DeFi\\nMandate #2  - Design incentive structures that issue and manage reserve backed currencies**\\n\\nBy utilizing vBTC as a reserve asset, we reduce the floating supply and therefore provide price stability when interacting with demand driven by incentives to provide liquidity for vBTC\\n\\n**Liquidity Incentives**\\n\\nThe first stop for vBTC once bridged is the strudel. Finance farms. The protocol utilizes a sushi-style LP farm to issue 1 $TRDL per block split evenly among the following positions:\\n\\n- $TRDL:ETH(Pool0) (320%APY)\\n- vBTC:$TRDL (73.51%APY)\\n- vBTC:ETH (14.96%APY)\\n- vNFT::vBTC:PUNK:CC:BAYC (NA* APY)\\n\\n*have to develop code to calculate price on multi asset pool to use in APY formula. \\n\\n**Reserve Backed Currencies**\\n\\n**Orkan.finance**\\n\\n**$vBTC\'s peg through The Orkan** \\n- When $vBTC gets under the peg, $ORK bonds are issued to increase the treasury supply and therefore remove $vBTC from circulation\\n- When $vBTC gets above the peg, previously acquired $vBTC is exchanged by the protocol for other assets to diversify the treasury basket or to buy back and burn $ORK.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b2V7Yoo.png)\\n\\n**vBTC as a Store of Value**\\n\\nThe Orkan treasury has managed to retain most of the value issued for the purchase of vBTC even though the market has gone through a significant downturn. ORK is trading at .40c, whereas the backing per token is 1.22c.\\n\\n**\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5MitiCushqui\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5**\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/axrQqVG.png)\\n\\n\\nWe recently deployed MitiCushqui, a [stablecoin issuing protocol](https://y.at/\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5). This protocol can be used to deploy redeemable stablecoins backed by a fixed ratio of a base stablecoin and any other asset. \\n\\nThe protocol oracles the BTC price and therefore creates an arbitrage where users can mint $Miti  at a discount and redeem for USDC. The vault keeps vBTC out of circulation therefore reducing the supply and increasing the price until the arbitrage is closed and the peg is met. \\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UC5UXFw.png)\\n\\n## The Future of Bitcoin is on-chain and the on-chain future is Bitcoin.\\n\\nTo make the web3 ecosystem more robust, we need to onboard a more significant percentage of BTC on-chain. A way to achieve reliable yields is to incentivize the flow of BTC into Web3. This capital can finance projects that generate value for the entire space. This makes BTC more useful, which is vital For it to gain mainstream adoption.\\n\\nThe future of BTC cannot depend on any one group of developers or caretakers. To realize its potential, we must find ways to bridge it into the Web3 ecosystem by utilizing as many techniques as possible and later building tools to create an interoperable interface\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn More:\\n\\nStrudel Twitter: @EnterTheStrudel\\nAt0x Twitter: @At0xNQ\\nNerd Chat: https://y.at/\ud83e\udd13\u2709\ufe0f\ud83e\udd13\\nStrudel Landing: https://y.at/\ud83c\udf2a\ud83c\udf2a\ud83d\udc40\\nMitiCushqui: https://y.at/\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5"}]}')}}]);
