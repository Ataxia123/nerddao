This year, it was held in Bogota, Colombia. For a week, participants discussed Ethereum development and other related topics.</p><p>One of the main goals of Devcon is to build a strong network of developers who can work together to improve Ethereum and create new applications using its technology. In this way, Devcon also serves as a sort of &quot;network state&quot; - a community with the capacity for collective action that can fund territory around the world and eventually gain diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states.</p><p>A side note on the the venue for the conference, Agora: It is a huge, imposing structure located in the heart of Bogota. It&#x27;s one of the largest convention centers in all of South America, and it&#x27;s constantly buzzing with activity. The building has a long and storied history, and it&#x27;s played a major role in the development of Bogota.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/7YNHaGC.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The Agora Building was originally built back in 1954. It was initially used as a livestock market, but it soon became clear that there was much more potential for the building. In 1967, the Agora building was repurposed into a convention center. This proved to be a major boon for Bogota, as the city quickly became a major destination for conventions and trade shows.</p><p> This was a perfect setting to host the Network State, and the organizers went above and beyond to make sure that everyone had a great time. The main talks of the conference were very insightful, and it was great to see so many people come together to discuss ways to scale Ethereum and resist censorship.</p><p>I like to think of the Network State as a &quot;collective of collectives&quot; where everyone is representing the communities they belong to. This was evident at Devcon, where developers from all over the world came together to showcase their projects and share their experiences. One of the main benefits of being part of this community is the ability to radically collaborate. </p><p>The only real way to become part of the network state is to join one of the communities that makes up the network state. I came into DevCon representing NerdQuarters but also connected to and ended up representing the BuidlGuidl. The BuidlGuidl.com is a collective of web3 builders that believe that by sharing ideas and working together, we will able to make faster progress than what we would have been able to achieve on our own. The Guild has a tool <a href="https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scaffold-ETH</a> that makes it easy to start developing in Web3. We then spent the whole time talking to other projects about how we could coordinate to create even more compelling use cases. Its a community built on the Open Source ethos and composability.</p><p> My time with the buidlguidl let me experience firsthand the support and camaraderie that members provide one another. This was especially apparent during the week-long conference, where developers were eager to help one another learn new skills and solve problems. We were showcasing <a href="https://speedrunethereum.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://speedrunethereum.com</a> which is a tool to learn Web3 development and make it easty to start making dapps. We heard from many atendees that told us that the speedrun helped them to understand Web3 or that they had used it to write the smart contracts that won ETHBogota. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/iLXESal.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The sense of community that exists within the BuidlGuidl is incredibly valuable, as it allows members to feel like they are a part of something larger than themselves. The buidlguidl supports its members by giving streams to meaningful crontributions. We also will play a key role between protocols and developers by creating starter kits along with prizes that incentivize our members to discover new protocols and create the next big thing on chain.</p><p>The future of the BuidlGuidl and the network state it represents is bright. With more and more people getting involved in Ethereum development, the community will only continue to grow and thrive.  Overall, DevCon was an incredible experience and everyone who attended should be very proud of what they have accomplished. The parties at the conference were also a lot of fun, and it was great to see so many people come together to celebrate this amazing technology.</p><p>Join the Nerds! <a href="https://y.at/%F0%9F%A4%93%E2%9C%89%F0%9F%A4%93" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://y.at/🤓✉🤓</a></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/nerddao/blog/tags/nerddao">nerddao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/nerddao/blog/tags/dev-con">DevCon</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/nerddao/blog/tags/ethereum">ethereum</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/nerddao/blog/infinite-universe">Infinite Universe Alliance Announcement</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-10-27T19:03:44.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 27, 2022</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">At0x</span></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">chief nerd</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a class="hash-link" href="#introduction" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/VnCExrM.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The Observable Universe is finite, and it hasn&#x27;t existed forever. It extends 46 billion light years in every direction from us. However, when telescopes fail our imagination can take us to infinity and beyond. A revolutionary new kind of camera was recently invented. Instead of turning light into pictures, it turns ideas into pictures using AI.This new kind of camera replicates what your imagination does. It receives words and then synthesizes a picture from its experience seeing millions of other pictures. the result is a synthograph (meaning synthetic drawing). With these synthographs we can explore the Infinite Universe.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="infinite-universe-alliance">Infinite Universe Alliance<a class="hash-link" href="#infinite-universe-alliance" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The Infinite Universe Alliance is a collection of 10,000 unique Captains(and Gods!) that inhabit the Infinite Universe. The collection was created using a structured prompt with distinct elements that determine the NFT&#x27;s attributes. We have spent over 400 hours of computing time and picked each output individually to imagine impossible and unique Superheroes, Supervillains and Gods that create a rich internal narrative that you can build on as you please.</p><p>We hope that this sets the stage for the community to collectively create a galaxy of stories in which these entities strive for survival, control and expansion throughout the Infinite Universe</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-we-did-it">How we did it<a class="hash-link" href="#how-we-did-it" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In order to create a cohesive collection we designed a structured prompt. Each part of the prompt is turned into a trait in the collection. In the table below we show some examples of how the prompts are structured.</p><table><thead><tr><th>[Type]</th><th>[Attributes]</th><th>[Modifiers]</th><th>[Faction]</th><th>[Allignment]</th><th>[Output]</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Captain</td><td>🔮 🐌</td><td>robot</td><td>Superhero</td><td>chaotic neutral</td><td><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/K96c1NM.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></td></tr><tr><td>Captain</td><td>incredible</td><td>warrior</td><td>Supervillian</td><td>chaotic good</td><td><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/oyP6BoA.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></td></tr><tr><td>Captain</td><td>🔥star</td><td>---------------</td><td>Superhero</td><td>chaotic neutral</td><td><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/s796taW.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></td></tr><tr><td>God of</td><td>🔥🍌</td><td>---------------</td><td>---------------</td><td>chaotic neutral</td><td><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/QquxL2p.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></td></tr></tbody></table><p>We started by determining whether it&#x27;s a Captain or a God, then we chose their defining characteristics and the subject modifier. The subject modifiers were discovered in the process of generating thousands of variations. Examples of modifiers are robot, samurai, zombie. These keywords act as a filter for the AI which create a specific look that we can mix with the other portions of the prompt. </p><p>To maintain consistency, we divided all captains into either Superheroes or a Supervillains . Finally, we used the standard alignment chart made popular in tabletop RPG games to create a variety of unique outputs for each prompt. The result is a collection of 10,000 completely unique characters that share a consistent set of traits through which  many different power levels themes and styles are represented. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="built-in-provenance">Built in Provenance<a class="hash-link" href="#built-in-provenance" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A side effect of synthography is that every output contains a hash that corresponds to the Midjourney job ID that created it. This will also be encoded as an extra trait that will allow users to verify the provenance of the NFT down to the timestamp when it was created. The collection was generated over 10 days of nonstop spamming prompts between a few synthers that jammed off of each other ideas to create all the variety that we now present. Someone could determine who came up with the original zombie (Doug09 did) and then you can see them appear across the collection and become one of the features of the middle part of the generation. As more people joined in new concepts are included which are then explored by the group. Overall creating this collection has been an incredible experience in imagination, collaboration and creative expression.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="this-is-not-a-metaverse-its-an-infinite-universe">THIS IS NOT A METAVERSE, it&#x27;s an Infinite Universe<a class="hash-link" href="#this-is-not-a-metaverse-its-an-infinite-universe" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The NFT market is filled with projects selling you their &quot;Metaverse&quot;. However, we believe that they&#x27;re all wrong. A metaverse is a collection of universes you can traverse. We already live in the metaverse. It&#x27;s made out of our base reality plus the Star Wars Universe, the Marvel Universe, the Bored Ape YC universe and so on. Maybe they dont know it, but they&#x27;re all building their own Universe, which is a PART of THE Metaverse.</p><p>The purpose of the NFT collection is to establish a base cannon where all of the entities we created exist within the same Infinite Universe. That means that owning an NFT of this collection gives you the ability to tell a part of the story of the AI-U yourself. With synthography you can create an infinity of worlds, challenges and adventures for your character to explore. Collectively the sum of these stories will create the most awesome adventure ever told.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="links">Links<a class="hash-link" href="#links" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/gMvN2S5Rpm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://discord.gg/gMvN2S5Rpm</a></p><p>Webpage: <a href="https://ai-universe.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ai-universe.io/</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/AI_UniverseNFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@AI_UniverseNFT</a></p><p>NerdQuarters:<a href="https://y.at/%F0%9F%A4%93%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%A4%93" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://y.at/🤓✉️🤓</a></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/nerddao/blog/tags/nerd">nerd</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/nerddao/blog/tags/nft">nft</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/nerddao/blog/tags/ai-universe">AIUniverse</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/nerddao/blog/Nerd-Bogota">NerdBogota</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-10-10T20:52:09.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 10, 2022</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">At0x</span></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">chief nerd</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/KBg0WjR.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>From all over the world Nerds have travelled to Bogota, Colombia to participate in the EthBogota hackathon and DevCon. The hackathon has come to an end with over 900 hackers participating and over 200 projects made over a single weekend. It is the biggest hackathon ever in LatAm.</p><p>The main goal of these events is to connect Ethereans together and strenghen the community around creating cool stuff. I&#x27;d like to share my experience so that buidlers who are on the fence about participating in these events can get a sense of how cool it is to get together and buidl with buidlers in the same buidling.</p><p>Once you decide to go to a Hackathon you should start brainstorming about what you would like to buidl. It can literally be anything but I personally like to think about a specific problem i&#x27;d like to solve. At first it may feel like a pretty daunting task. But the most important thing about these events is that you&#x27;re not alone. If you cant come up with anything its time to talk to other people and see what theyre trying to build and join the team that you find the most interesting. Although you can hack solo, you have way better chances if you join up with others that can complent your skillset and bring new ideas into the project. </p><p>EthGlobal.com runs the hackathon events like a well oiled machine. You have plenty of avenues to reach out and connect to other people and there are several mentors available alongisde with the teams that sponsor the event in order to get more people to use their stack. I met my team members through the discord chat and after a team building event early on. At the event itself you have infinite coffee and plenty of food to keep you going throughout the weekend. ALthough the internet does get shoddy at times with all the npm installs going on.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="let-the-hack-begin">Let the Hack Begin!<a class="hash-link" href="#let-the-hack-begin" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Once your team has been formed and the hackathon officially begins. Its off to the races. Every team has a different strategy, but there are some important things to consider. The goal of the event is to showcase an idea, not necesarily a production stage. You want to get to the proof of concept as soon as possible and then build extra functionalities on top. You can stay at the venue 24/7 and a big percentage of people do, but it is also important to pace youself so that you can do good presentations at the end. </p><p>An important thing to keep in mind is that you dont necesarly need to be a super coder to participate in these events. There is a lot of work to be done in any project around documentation, graphic design, product ideation and narrative that really makes a difference to make your project stand out. </p><p>The judging process for the hacks is very brief and you dont really get too much time to go over small details, so its important to get straight to the point and try to have a long lasting impression. At the end of the day the Hackathon is not about winning but rather sharing ideas and connecting to people. I hope more Nerds will start participating in these events soon. Here is our submission to the hackathon. If you find it interesting and would like to help out with this idea feel free to reach out at the NerdQuarters.</p><p align="center"></p><h1> Allyu.xyz </h1><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/cikwHhm.png" class="img_ev3q"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-community-based-protocol-to-issue-crypto-backed-money">A community-based protocol to issue crypto-backed money<a class="hash-link" href="#a-community-based-protocol-to-issue-crypto-backed-money" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="objectives">Objectives:<a class="hash-link" href="#objectives" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>ya</p><ul><li>To create a system that communities can leverage to issue their own trustless paper money backed entirely by crypto deposits.</li><li>Onboard community leaders into crypto and enable them to lead by example in the adoption of web3.</li><li>To increase the transactability of Ethereum based products by introducing them into the heart of the Latin American community: the corner store. allowing recipients to purchase food and other vital supplies with crypto money</li></ul><p>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a class="hash-link" href="#introduction" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In order to gain mass adoption, Web3 protocols need to start with the simplest use cases in order to address the needs of a majority of the world&#x27;s population.

These three characteristics are not independent of each other since once any kind of money has value it can be used to fulfill those three functions.

post-work collective of highly capable individuals who gather to talk about anything related to being a Nerd. we tend to talk about cryptocurrencies and the latest developments in science art technology politics and economics. everyone is welcome and its free to join as long as you stay nerdy.</p><p> A word about myself. I&#x27;m known online as At0x.eth. Before being in crypto I became a M.D but took interest in data science and worked with a research group publishing several papers. Basically, I have always been a huge nerd. I used to play countless hours of WoW as a kid and have been running VR side hustles for over 5 years now. </p><center><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/xghFgmOKbk0G4" width="480" height="321" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/smiling-spongebob-squarepants-nerd-xghFgmOKbk0G4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p></center><p>I&#x27;ve been aware of blockchain for a long time but did only start participating around june 2020 because covid made me reconsider my carreer choice. When I first joined into crypto telegram madness, I found there was no room for deep technical discourse if it was not related to a &quot;when pump&quot; statement. In a space where &quot;in it for the technology&quot; is used as a joke I needed to create a group where we&#x27;re really in it for the tech. a place for Nerds.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enter-the-nerdquarters">Enter The NerdQuarters<a class="hash-link" href="#enter-the-nerdquarters" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://y.at/%F0%9F%A4%93%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%A4%93" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://y.at/🤓✉️🤓</a></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/MantluU.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The Nerdquarters is the core of the Nerd community. We have created an open source community where nerds come and share information to make sense of it together. It is also a place for newcomers to ask questions and avoid repeating the same mistakes we&#x27;ve already learned from.</p><p>As we have grown we have started to interact with alot of new tools for decentralized communities which have allowed us to coordinate to embark on several ventures. We dont need venture capital money because we do everything in house. We just want to have fun and experience the growth of the infinite machine. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nerd-dao">NERD DAO<a class="hash-link" href="#nerd-dao" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The Nerd DAO is the on chain representation of the NERD commuinity. We created the DAO using <a href="https://ethos.eth.link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EthOS</a>.  EthOS is a permissionless and decentralized governance protocol that allows anyone to create their own DAO with its own token, treasury and governance interface. We are one of the earliest external users of EthOS. </p><p>The Nerd DAO is not explicitly intended to be a for profit venture. The initial tokens were airdropped to members of the telegram chat. Over 80% of the supply is still held by the Treasury wallet. There are no insider backers and nobody has special privileges or access over the token. Furthermore the NERD Treasury owns the initial LP used for the token. However, we have undertaken for profit ventures in the form of products and services such as our Nerd Fungible Trust group investment and our upcoming <!-- -->[Redacted]<!-- --> trading platform which will pay fees to the DAO.</p><p>Through all these ventures and experiences we have learned a thing or two about how the metaverse is being built. We have also started to etch our own corned of the metaverse by starting to interconnect experiences and information through Web3 interfaces. As our network becomes more expansive we&#x27;re starting to learn what the metaverse really is and how its different from the way we used to do things.
