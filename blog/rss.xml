Go and take your place with the alchemists."</em></strong> </p><p>‚Äî‚ÄâLeonardo da Vinci, 1494</p><p>Perpetual motion is the motion of bodies that <strong><em>continues forever in an unperturbed system. A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that can do work infinitely without an external energy source.</em></strong> This kind of machine is impossible, as it would violate either the first or second law of thermodynamics or both.</p><p>Luckily for us we're dealing with the laws of crypto economics, not thermodynamics. The behavior of monetary systems can in fact be modeled using Physic's first principles and the inmaterial nature of it allows for the creation of systems that go beyon the constraints of the phisical world. However, the laws of thermodiamics offer a glimpse of what is required to create an infinitely sustainable monetary system, which in fact is a perpetual motion machine.</p><p><strong><em>The first law</em></strong> describes the of conservation of energy states postulating that the total energy of any isolated system (for which energy and matter transfer through the system boundary are not possible) is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed.</p><p><strong><em>The second law</em></strong> may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium where the entropy is highest at the given internal energy</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="money-is-a-form-of-energy">Money is a form of Energy<a class="hash-link" href="#money-is-a-form-of-energy" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>In physics, <strong><em>energy</em></strong> is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes. In other words, both money and energy can be described as a quantitative property that is transfered in exchange for work. Unlike energy however, money can in fact be created and destroyed. Which is the first key we need to create a perpetual motion machine</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-entropy-be-reduced">Can Entropy be Reduced?<a class="hash-link" href="#can-entropy-be-reduced" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p><strong><em>‚ÄúTHERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.‚Äù</em></strong></p><p>-Multivac, 2061</p><p><strong><em>Entropy</em></strong> is a scientific concept as well as a measurable physical property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. In the phisical world the overall entropy always increases: things tend to go from a state of order to disorder if left unchecked. Although the total entropy of the universe cannot ever decrease energy (read: money) can be spent to fight off entropy locally. Thats why we eat food in order and reduce our body entropy by repairing and replacing cells. Ultimately however, in the physical world entropy always wins. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="entropy-reduction--value-creation">Entropy Reduction = Value Creation<a class="hash-link" href="#entropy-reduction--value-creation" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Imagine you could deploy custom laws of physics. Thats what solidity is like. If entropy is a measure of unceartanty smart contracts are anti-entropy devices for they describe deterministic functions that organize energy(read: money). For example; The UniSwap smart contracts organize thousands of pairs from houndreds of thousands of users in order to allow atomic swaps between any asset pair. The fact that UniSwap is deployed in the network reduces the total entropy and increased the value of everything within.</p><p>In the case of StrudelDAO our source of entropy is the vBTC peg. Our protocol aims to reduce this entropy by deploying incentive structures that produce energy (read: money) in order to incentivize actions that achieve this goal. Once we manage to achieve the peg we know that value will have ben created for the protocol which we can compound on by offering a product that can be built upon by other protocols which are also creating on chain value. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/X0iDfFy.png" class="img_ev3q">
